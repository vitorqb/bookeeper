* Bookeeper

  A silly program I made to learn some clojure.
  It is intended to keep track of your readings.

** Example
   First we need to prepare an sqlite3 database and apply the
   migrations to it. This will work:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ # Prepares a dir
$ mkdir -p ~/.bookeeper/
$ # Exports an env var telling which db should be used
$ export BOOKEEPER_DB_FILE=~/.bookeper/db.sqlite3 
$ # Runs the migrations
$ lein migrate
> Applying 001-books-table
> Applying 002-reading-sessions-table
#+END_EXAMPLE

   We can now add our first book! =D

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ lein run add-book --title 'Clojure for the Brave and True'
$ lein run query-books
> [1] [Clojure for the Brave and True]
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Now let's add two reading sessions for it.
   Note: duration is considered seconds.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ lein run read-book -t 'Clojure for the Brave and True' -d 2019-01-20 --duration 600
$ lein run query-reading-sessions
> [2019-01-20] [Clojure for the Brave and True] [600]
#+END_EXAMPLE

   And we can add a second reading sessions and ask for the total
   ammount of time we have spent with it.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ lein run read-book -t 'Clojure for the Brave and True' -d 2019-01-20 --duration 1200
$ lein run query-reading-sessions
> [2019-01-20] [Clojure for the Brave and True] [1200]
> [2019-01-20] [Clojure for the Brave and True] [600]
$ lein run time-spent -t 'Clojure for the Brave and True'
> 1800
#+END_EXAMPLE

   And that is it. I told it was silly.

** Development

*** Starting a nrepl
    
    A shortcut to start a nrepl session for completion (with cider) is:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
;; file: $HOME/.lein/profiles.clj
{:repl {:plugins [[cider/cider-nrepl "0.20.0"]]}}
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
lein start-repl-server
#+END_EXAMPLE

   Them, from emacs, ~cider-connect~ and select host 127.0.0.1 and port 4123.

*** Migrations

    A shortcut to run migrations is

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ lein migrate
#+END_EXAMPLE

    And to rollback

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ lein rollback
#+END_EXAMPLE
